Tangible Landscape
==================
![header image](readme_image.jpg "Tangible Landscape plugin")

Tangible Landscape is an open source tangible interface for geospatial modeling powered by GRASS GIS. Tangible Landscape couples a physical model with a digital model of a landscape so that you can naturally feel, reshape, and interact with the landscape. This makes geographic information systems (GIS) far more intuitive and accessible for beginners, empowers geospatial experts, and creates new opportunities for developers.

This repository contains Tangible Landscape plugin for GRASS GIS, which allows
a real-time feedback cycle of interaction, 3D scanning, point cloud processing, geospatial computation and projection

Installation:
----------------------------------
We support installation on Ubuntu 18.04, for other versions and Linux distributions please modify the script accordingly. Tangible Landscape requires Microsoft Kinect for Xbox (v2). Software dependencies include:

-   GRASS GIS >= 7.2
-   GRASS GIS addon [r.in.kinect](https://github.com/ncsu-osgeorel/r.in.kinect)
-   Python package [watchdog](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog), optionally [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

1. Make a folder where all the dependencies will be compiled:

       mkdir tangiblelandscape && cd tangiblelandscape

2. Download [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangible-landscape/tangible-landscape-install/master/install_Ubuntu-18.04.sh) to that folder (check [this repo for other Ubuntu versions](https://github.com/tangible-landscape/tangible-landscape-install)) and run it:

       sh install_Ubuntu-18.04.sh

    It will ask you for administrator password. You need to be online to download all dependencies. After finishing the process, log out and log in.

3. Find GRASS GIS in Dash and start it. Create a new GRASS Location or use an existing one, and when GRASS Layer Manager opens, go to tab Console and type:

       g.gui.tangible
